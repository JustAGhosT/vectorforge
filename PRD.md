- **Processing Failures** - Graceful error with retry option

## Design Direction

The design should feel cutting-edge yet approachable—like a professional tool that's been refined to its essence. Clean, modern minimalism with purposeful moments of visual polish. The interface should recede when showing results but provide confident guidance during setup. Think Apple-level finish with Google-level accessibility.

## Color Selection

**Triadic** - Using a technology-forward palette that communicates precision and innovation. The three core colors (purple, cyan, orange) create visual interest while maintaining professional credibility.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Purple `oklch(0.45 0.18 285)` - Communicates creativity and innovation without feeling playful
- **Secondary Colors**: 
  - Vibrant Cyan `oklch(0.7 0.15 195)` - Represents digital precision and technical capability
  - Energetic Orange `oklch(0.7 0.16 45)` - Provides warmth and highlights actions
- **Accent Color**: Bright Orange `oklch(0.75 0.18 45)` - CTAs and important interactive elements demand attention
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (Soft White `oklch(0.98 0 0)`): Dark Charcoal text `oklch(0.25 0 0)` - Ratio 13.2:1 ✓
  - Card (Pure White `oklch(1 0 0)`): Dark Charcoal text `oklch(0.25 0 0)` - Ratio 14.8:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Purple): White text `oklch(1 0 0)` - Ratio 5.2:1 ✓
  - Secondary (Light Gray `oklch(0.96 0 0)`): Medium Gray text `oklch(0.35 0 0)` - Ratio 10.1:1 ✓
  - Accent (Bright Orange): White text `oklch(1 0 0)` - Ratio 4.9:1 ✓
  - Muted (Subtle Gray `oklch(0.94 0 0)`): Dark Gray text `oklch(0.45 0 0)` - Ratio 7.8:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should communicate technical precision while remaining highly legible. A clean sans-serif that feels modern without being trendy, with careful attention to number rendering for technical details.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (App Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter-spacing (-0.02em)
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter SemiBold/24px/normal letter-spacing
  - H3 (Card Titles): Inter Medium/18px/normal letter-spacing
  - Body (Interface Text): Inter Regular/14px/relaxed line-height (1.6)
  - Caption (Metadata): Inter Regular/12px/medium gray color
  - Button Labels: Inter Medium/14px/slight letter-spacing (0.01em)

## Animations

Animations should feel responsive and purposeful—reinforcing the sense that this is a powerful tool working intelligently. Quick, physics-based transitions that guide attention without demanding it.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Processing animations communicate active work happening, while completion states celebrate success
